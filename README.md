Long Term, offline Access to Google Calendar of a User via Website with PHP

I had the need for accessing the Google Calendar of my Users for a Web-Project.
It was not so easy to find and collect everything together so wanted to provide this
as a simply to use method. 

It allows you to:
- get Access to the Google Calendar of your Users
- keep Access, even if the User goes offline
- have Access for a very long time without needing authorization from the user again
- read and write events to a calendar

I am no professional programmer. Please excuse unclean programming style, missing exception handling etc. :-)
